# IUPUI Tutorials

This directory contains a set of tutorials throughout my PhD studies.  It utilizes Pipenv for setting up environments.  Setup is straightforward:

```
pipenv install
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

The environment comes with a Jupyter Notebook environment.  Simply run it with the following:

```
pipenv run jupyter-notebook
```

From there, a browser window/tab will open, and you'll be able to access each of the notebooks (given that the code is a Jupyter Notebook).
